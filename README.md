# **Week 3 : Assignment**

In this assignment for the project "Diving into ML", we shall build a neural network from scratch, using the template code given above. This programming assignment is based on classification of images from the MNIST database. You have to classify the images to their labels, from 0 to 9, corresponding to the digit on each image.

The resources for this week can be found in the resources folder in the repo.

This week's programming assignment has a jupyter notebook which contains the problem statement. You are supposed to fill in missing code wherever indicated and provide detailed observations wherever asked.

Your assignment will be scored on the basis of : 

* Error-free execution
* Accuracy of results obtained
* Well-formatted graphs
* Detailed analysis whenever observations are asked
* Good programming practices (such as comments, indentation)

The deadline for the submission of this assignment is 22 January, 11:59 PM

Any doubts/suggestions can be asked on the group. All resources required including the libraries to be used, the dataset to be used have been linked in the notebook.
